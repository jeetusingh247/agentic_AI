# Diagrams

This folder contains system diagrams (Mermaid) for the agentic_AI project. Each file includes a Mermaid diagram and a short explanation. You can open these Markdown files in VS Code and render the Mermaid diagrams with an appropriate extension.

Files:
- `component.md` — component diagram showing main services and responsibilities.
- `deployment.md` — deployment diagram mapping components to managed services (Phase 1 recommendation).
- `dataflow.md` — data-flow diagram for typical end-to-end flows.
- `sequence_agent_creation.md` — sequence diagram for creating an agent.
- `sequence_task_execution.md` — sequence diagram for task execution and LLM calls (including streaming).

If you want PNG/SVG exports, I can generate them or add PlantUML sources on request.
